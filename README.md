# PhoneApplication
An application that allows the user to update variety of smartphones such as iPhone and Android.
This application allows users to add, edit and display to check the changes done by the user. In addition, some smartphones are added to the app so the user can check its description and decide whether to keep the phone or delete/change the collection of smartphones added in the app. Below is the screenshot of the menu diagram with each option and its purpose.
